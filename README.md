# Testomonial-Grid
This project is a responsive testimonial grid designed to showcase customer testimonials. It demonstrates two commonly used design approaches: mobile-first and desktop-first. 
# Mobile-First Approch
In the "mobile-first" version of this project:

- Testimonials are displayed in a single column to fit smaller screens.
- The layout is simple and easy to navigate, with a focus on readability.
- Media queries are used to apply styling and layout changes for larger screens.
- This approach prioritizes a great mobile experience and progressively improves the design for larger screens.

# Desktop-First Approch
In the "desktop-first" version of this project:

- Testimonials are initially displayed in a grid format designed for desktop screens.
- The grid layout takes advantage of the larger screen real estate.
- Media queries are used to adapt the design for smaller screens, such as tablets and mobile devices.
- This approach provides a visually rich experience on larger screens and adjusts the layout for smaller screens to ensure usability.
